/*
The full goiardi documentation has been moved out of this file because it was
getting too big to be easily manageable. It now uses sphinx to manage and format
the documentation, which can be found under the `docs/` directory. To learn
about sphinx-doc, see http://sphinx-doc.org/. The documentation can also be
found online at http://goiardi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. The godocs for
goiardi are now focused on development and internals.
