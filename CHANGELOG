1.0.0 (not released yet)
-----
* Organizations and RBAC. This includes stuff like groups, ACLs, and whatnot.
* Refactor of HTTP handling to use gorilla-mux.
* Dropped MySQL support. It's the in-memory store, PostgreSQL, or nothin'.
* Removed the long-deprecated --use-unsafe-mem-store option.
* Changed index-val-trim's default behavior - if not set, it defaults to
  trimming values at 150 characters.
* Finally removed the deprecated & unused chefcrypto module inside goiardi - it
  was moved to a separate module back in November of 2016.
* Generate shovey signing keys within goiardi and provide the public key
  directly to clients.
* Shovey is orgified. This means that version >= X.Y.Z of 'schob' and version >=
  U.V.W of knife-shove are required for shovey.
* Switched over to use 'go mod'. While it's been built with go1.12 and go1.14,
  and might build with go1.11, it's unlikely to work with anything older. The
  vendor directory has been regenerated with 'go mod', however, and should work
  with older versions of go if that's how you roll.
* TODO: Plenty more to add when this is finally ready to release.

0.11.10 (Unreleased at this time)
-------
* It was brought to my attention by <WHO> that 'create_key' is now a valid JSON
  hash key for when creating clients with newer chef tools. Added it to the
  whitelist of valid elements for creating clients.

0.11.9
------
* Follow chef RFC041. Newer chef-clients and knifes (knives?) were breaking
  goiardi wasn't following this RFC by reporting the supported api versions.
  (Thanks julian7 for the PR and bringing it to my attention.)
* Remove dependency on golang.org/x/exp/utf8string - it's failing some tests on
  the Debian build servers, and goiardi's liable to get kicked out of testing
  shortly if it isn't addressed. Since goiardi wasn't actually using utf8string
  for anything real complicated, it was easy enough to tear that out and whip
  up a replacement with built-in functions. (Thanks jordi for bringing this
  situation to my attention as well.)

0.11.8
------
* Made some small tweaks and updates to the depsolver to make that a little
  better. NB: Down the road, there may be some further changes to the depsolver,
  especially where 'most constrained' cookbooks are concerned.
* Update the circleci config to use the version 2.0 syntax.
* Add purging old sandboxes that have been hanging around for too long.

0.11.7
------
* Allow access to /debug/pprof with a whitelist of IP addresses
* Properly index arrays of hashes, arrays of arrays, etc. in object attributes.
* Pretty serious memory usage improvements with search (both the in-memory
  and postgres searches).
* Fix reconnecting to serf if the connection is somehow interrupted.
* Fix negated range queries (it turns out they *do* have a use after all), and 
  refactor how NOT queries are handled generally.
* Add options to purge old reports and node statuses.
* Add option to skip logging extended object information in the event log.
* A handful of other bugfixes.
* Bump up to using golang 1.9.3 for builds.
* Minor changes to the documentation.

0.11.6 (cancelled)
------
* Skipped because of a miscommunication snafu involving Debian packaging and a
  pre-release tag for 0.11.6.

0.11.5
------
* Several search fixes:
  - With postgres search:
    * Fixed reindexing after it broke with the previous update that eliminated
    a lot of unneeded extra rows in the database.
    * Fixed basic queries with NOT statements.
    * Separately, fixed using NOT with subqueries. On a somewhat complicated
      note, but in a way that appears to match standard Solr behavior, when
      doing a query like "name:chef* AND NOT (admin:true OR admin:bleh)" it
      works as is, but when a negated subquery is followed by another basic
      query statement, it needs to have extra parentheses around the NOT +
      subquery, like "name:chef* AND (NOT (admin:true OR admin:bleh)) AND
      public_key:*". A convoluted and unlikely scenario, but it could happen.
  - With in-memory search:
    * NOT + subqueries was also broken with the in-mem search. The fixes for
      the pg-search partially fixed it for in-mem in that it no longer made the
      server panic, but it was returning incorrect results. Additional work
      ended up being needed for in-mem search.

0.11.4
------
* Implement Chef authentication version 1.3.
* Move the custom goiardi error type out of util and into its own module.
  Wrappers around the new module are in util still for convenience, and
  because the functions and interface are used all over the place.
* Many endpoints now handle HEAD requests where appropriate. With some
  endpoints this is not especially useful, but with others it's a lightweight
  way to see what resources exist and so forth. Implements Chef RFC 090.
* Start using contexts with requests. This does mean that goiardi will require
  at least go 1.7. (As of 0.11.3 goiardi only supported go 1.7+, but it was
  likely to build with somewhat older versions anyway.)
* Minor bugfixes - deal with a possible race condition with the in-mem search
  index, change some logging statements from Info to Debug that didn't need to
  be Info level and removed a test log statement that was no longer necessary,
  updated copyright dates.
* Add the Chef API version header to responses.
* Change behavior if the data file and use-(mysql|postgresql) are specified
  together; formerly it was a fatal error, but now it'll just emit a warning
  in the error log and ignore the data file setting.

0.11.3
------
* Add an option to trim values in search indexes. Currently not enabled by
  default, but will be in the next minor goiardi release (so, either 0.12.0 or
  1.0.0, depending on which ends up being next). Existing indexes ought to be
  reindexed upon upgrading, but they should still work if this is skipped.
* Fix a bug where duplicated items in slices in objects being indexed with the
  in-memory trie based index would cause goiardi to crash. For good measure,
  even though it isn't necessary to prevent a crash remove those same
  duplicate items from objects being indexed with the postgres index.
* Mark --use-unsafe-mem-store as deprecated. In the unlikely event someone's
  using that option, a warning will print in the log. This option may be
  removed at any time.
* Allow setting configuration options via environment variables. (See
  the documentation for the details.)
* Finally allow configuring MySQL or PostgreSQL connection options with
  command line flags (or, now, environment variables).
* Fixed format issues and wording in a few places in the documentation, along
  with updating the docs for the current version.
* Add a hidden flag to generate a simple man page.
* Add that simple man page, along with the html docs, to the packagecloud.io
  packages.
* Add a Dockerfile to allow running the local goiardi source in docker.
* Add Debian "stretch" and Ubuntu "yakkety yak" to the distro versions we have
  in the package repository.

0.11.2
------
* Fix a bug with escaped characters in certain searches (thanks ickymettle).
  Does require rebuilding the search index.
* Allow using 'novault' as a build tag to avoid having to have the vault api
  present when building goiardi. Not relevant to most people.

0.11.1
------
* Allow storing secrets (client & user public keys, shovey signing private
  keys, and user password hashes) in an external service. Currently only vault
  is supported.
* Rework reindexing to break it into smaller chunks and ensure that only one
  reindexing job can run at a time.
* Package goiardi for RHEL 7 and Debian jessie for s390x. Rather experimental,
  of course.

0.11.0
------
* Ability to upload cookbooks to S3.
* Add script to upload local files to S3 to migrate.
* Change how items are indexed with the postgres indexer, to reduce the number
  of rows in the search_items table substantially (at the cost of possible
  differences in search results in a few weird corner cases).
* Search parser no longer chokes on Unicode. Unfortunately Postgres' ltree
  module does not accept all Unicode alphanumeric characters as valid still.
* Use vendoring.
* Rejigger the package building process a bit - changing how the different
  packages are built and how version numbers are determined.
* Fix a long-standing annoyance where the log file would get truncated when
  goiardi started or restarted.
* Allow passing environment variables to goiardi through the config file.
* Fix in-memory indexer to work with go 1.7.
* Add packages for CentOS 6 and 7. Also use a gox fork pulling in someone's PR
  with better ARM support until that gets merged upstream eventually.
* Change the postgres columns using the 'json' data type to use 'jsonb'
  instead. This is generally better, but does mean that goiardi now requires
  PostgreSQL 9.4 or later.

0.10.4
------
* Export pprof info over HTTP, but only accept connections from localhost for
  that information.
* Add statsd metrics for things like chef-client run timings (requires
  reporting) and started/succeeded/failed, number of nodes, API endpoint 
  timings, various pieces of runtime info like GC pauses, RAM used, and number
  of resources updated & total resources for client runs.
* Fix JSON decoding issue where very large numbers would suddenly turn into
  floats.

0.10.3
------
* Handle someone trying to use syslog on Windows ourselves, rather than
  letting the logging library do it (it was causing trouble with gox).

0.10.2
------
* Fix up packaging and deploy scripts a bit
* Add sql schemas to the deb
* Fixed a logic error when configuring the address to listen on where the
  value specified in the config file was always ignored, and only an address
  specified on the command line worked. (Thanks to jordi and DQEbert here for
  bringing this to my attention.)
* Added options to specify proxy hostname and port different than what goairdi
  itself is listening on. (Thanks to jordi and DQEbert here as well.)
* CoC
* Added Debian wheezy to the list of distros we generate packages for.
* The logging library goiardi used moved. It had been forked, but since the
  dependencies of said fork also moved, goiardi switched to the new version of
  that library. Happily the logger library had added logging to syslog as an
  option, so we just went back to using upstream at the new location.  (Thanks
  to theckman for providing a fix for this.)
* In concert with the above, add a "fatal" log level.
* Terraform removed the depgraph module, so that's been vendored into goiardi
  along with its digraph dependency.

0.10.1
------
* Fix some tests
* Scripts, configuration files for more efficient packaging
* circleci integration
* Bomb on importing data if public keys don't validate. (thanks jordi and 
  DQEbert for bringing this to my attention.)
* Validate older PKCS#1 keys -- golang's stdlib pukes on them without some
  massaging. (thanks jordi and DQEbert for bringing this to my attention.)
* Fix reindexing - databags were not being reindexed with the postgres search,
  and the SaveItem calls were moved to goroutines; otherwise, the request
  from knife would time out and knife would restart the reindex.
* Allow '.' in cookbook names; despite what an error chef-pedant is looking
  for, those are allowed. (thanks jordi and DQEbert for bringing this to my 
  attention.)
* Make the authentication lib more general (thanks theckman)
* Output the version of golang used to build a particular goiardi binary
  (again, thanks theckman)
* The changed hostname in URLs to download bug didn't get fixed in 0.7.1 quite
  all the way after all. It is now. (Thanks to oker1 for bringing that to my
  attention.)
* Fixed search tests to pass when run using more than one processor. (Brought
  to my attention by theckman.)
* Fixed a deadlock that could happen when saving an in-mem index to disk at
  the exact moment an object was being indexed. Seems to be specific to
  go1.5.1 (or at least it never happened before that I saw), but needs fixed
  anyway. (Also brought to my attention by theckman.)
* Fixed broken pipe errors with too large requests when running chef-pedant
  against goiardi built with go 1.5.1.
* Update some docs.

0.10.0
------
* Search architecture changed so different search backends can be used (thanks
  oker1 for your work on that).
* Postgres search is here at last! If you're using Postgres, instead of using
  the ersatz solr search, you can instead use Postgres to power your searches.
* Add a mutex for the original goiardi search - multiple simple queries
  executing simultaneously are not a problem, but multiple complex queries can 
  eat up all the RAM on the machine and cause goiardi to crash. This mitigates
  that situation.
* Be a little more forgiving with reporting protocol versions - allow
  specifying the protocol version as a query param instead of only as a
  header. This is to make showing reports with the webui a little easier.
* Bump the Chef Server version we claim to be from 11.1.6 to 11.1.7.

0.9.2
-----
* Fix broken import/export function with reports - bringing goiardi's variable
  naming inline with golang conventions a while back inadvertently renamed a
  reporting JSON field. The field was renamed, and the import code will now
  handle both correct and incorrect names for the node reporting.

0.9.1
-----
* Fix error where requests for zero byte cookbook files would crash.
* Authentication docs improvments (thanks oker1!)
* Rewritten and more robust cookbook depsolver.
* Fix for client creation with cheffish (thanks whiteley!)
* Fix for search where searching for something like "foo:bar AND NOT foo:bar"
  was returning incorrect results. (brought to my attention and test provided
  by brimstone, thanks!)
* Fixed a bug where clients could be created with the same name as a user (or
  vice versa) in in-memory mode.

0.9.0
-----
* Validate IP address supplied on the command line or in the config file.
* Compress index docs to reduce memory usage with the search index.
* Ordering searches works now.
* Index and datastore files now only write to disk if there have been changes
  since the last time they were saved.
* In tandem with the previous change, freeze interval default has been changed
  from 300 seconds to 10 seconds.
* Bump Chef Server version we claim to be from 11.1.3 to 11.1.6.

0.8.2
-----
* Fix typo with checking for an existing client in SQL mode.
* Fix typo in sample config file for postgres option.
* Add additional checks to the local filestore option to make sure the supplied
  directory name exists and is a directory.

0.8.1
-----
* Disable SSLv3 when using TLS.
* The main goiardi docs are now located at http://goiardi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

0.8.0
-----
* Introducing shovey, a facility for running commands on nodes without a full
  chef run.
* Goiardi can act as a serf client now. Mostly this is for shovey support, but
  it can also optionally announce logged events and startup over serf as serf 
  events.
* If serf is used, node statuses will be tracked by goiardi. This depends on
  receiving a heartbeat message from the shovey client.
* Add an error for the unlikely situation where an SQL function is called, yet
  no SQL database is configured.

0.7.2
-----
* Remove a newline in a debug statement, courtesy of @spheromak.
* Also per @spheromak's suggestion, fixed some possible race conditions
  revealed by building goiardi with the -race flag and running chef-pedant
  against it.
* Edit doc.go slightly to make godocs more attractive.

0.7.1
-----
* Add --db-pool-size and --max-connections options for configuring the number
  of idle db connections kept around and the maximum number of db connections
  to make to the server. It isn't particularly useful if you're not using one
  of the SQL backends.
* For locally stored cookbook files (which is currently all of them), goiardi
  now generates the URL to the resource from the currently configured
  hostname. This fixes an issue where if you uploaded a cookbook and then
  changed the goairdi server's hostname, the URLs to download cookbooks would
  break.

0.7.0
-----
* Add /universe API endpoint, per
  https://github.com/opscode/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc014-universe-endpoint.md.
* Make file uploading a little more forgiving.
* Make validating some cookbook metadata more forgiving, to bring goiardi's
  validations in line with erchef.
* Added some functions to make listing all cookbooks and recipes on the
  server faster and move the logic into the cookbook package.
* Breaking DB change: with both MySQL and Postgres, the way data structures
  for cookbooks, nodes, etc. has changed from gob encoding to using JSON. This
  obviously breaks existing items in the database, so the following steps must
  be followed by users using either SQL backend for data storage:

    * Export their goiardi server's data with the `-x` flag.
    * Either revert all changes to the db with sqitch, then redeploy, or drop 
      the database manually and recreate it from either the sqitch patches or 
      the full table dump of the release (provided starting with 0.7.0)
    * Reload the goiardi data with the `-m` flag.
  See the README or the godocs for more information.

0.6.1 (cancelled)
-----
* See notes for 0.7.0

0.6.0
-----
* Postgres support.
* Fix rebuilding indexes with an SQL backend.
* Fix a bug where in MySQL mode events were being logged twice.
* Fix an annoying chef-pedant error with data bags.
* Event logging methods that are not allowed now return Method Not Allowed
  rather than Bad Request.
* Switch the logger to a fork that can be built and used with Windows that
  excludes syslog when building on Windows.
* Add basic syslog support.
* Authentication protocol version 1.2 now supported.
* Add a 'status' param to reporting, so a list of reports return by 'knife
  runs' can be narrowed by the status of the chef run (started, success, and
  failure).
* Fix an action at a distance problem with in-memory mode objects. If this
  behavior is still desirable (it seems to be slightly faster than the new way),
  it can be turned back on with the --use-unsafe-mem-store flag. This change
  DEFINITELY breaks in-mem data file compatibility. If upgrading, export your 
  data, upgrade goiardi, and reload your data.
* Add several new searchable parameters for logged events.
* Add organization_id to all MySQL tables that might need it someday. Orgs are
  not used at all, so only the default value of 1 currently makes it to the 
  database.
* Finally ran 'go fmt' on goiardi. It didn't even mess up the long comment
  blocks, which was what I was afraid it would do. I also ran golint against
  goiardi and took its recommendations where it made sense, which was most
  areas except for some involving generated parser code, comments on
  GobEncode/Decode, commenting a bunch of identical functions on an interface
  in search, and a couple of cases involving make and slices. All in all,
  though, the reformatting, linting, and light refactoring has done it good.

0.5.2
-----
* Add import/export of goiardi data through a JSON dump.
* Add configuration options to specify the max sizes for objects uploaded to
  the filestore and for JSON requests from the client.

0.5.1
-----
* Add log levels (from debug to critical). This makes -V/--verbose useful.
* Add an easier option in the config file to specify log levels by name.
* ipv6 already worked, but accidentally. Now it works in a more deliberate
  fashion, preventing mishaps with addresses, colons, and port numbers.
* Authentication protocol version 1.1 now supported.
* Remove a sort on run lists that was there for some reason. I have no idea
  what it was put there for, but it was wrong.
* Add an event log to log changes to objects like nodes, clients, etc. See the
  README or godocs for details.
* Add support for reporting (http://docs.opscode.com/reporting.html)

0.5.0
-----
* MySQL support added
* No longer redirect /environments/NAME/roles/NAME to
  /roles/NAME/environments/NAME
* Update documentation, reformat godocs
* Split actors apart into separate user and client types, made new Actor
  interface that encompasses both users and clients.

0.4.2
-----
Bugfix release:
* Perm tweak for nodes updating themselves.
* Small change with validating role descriptions when creating or updating
  from JSON.
* Fix issue with saving complicated indexed objects to disk where improperly
  flattened indexable objects were making the gob encoder puke all over itself
  when encoding the tries in the index docs.
* Fixed a possible regression with synchronizing cookbooks that did not show
  up in testing, but only in real use.
* An absolutely bonkers fix for listing cookbook files with webui. Webui wants
  all of the cookbook top level attributes sent over with a request to
  /cookbooks/<name>/<version>, but this is the exact *opposite* of the
  behavior chef-pedant wants, where empty definitions, attributes, etc. are
  not sent over. Knife also seems quite content with this, so the fix for now,
  since the two cases are mutually exclusionary, is to only send the empty
  hashes for those top level attributes with a GET if the request is coming
  from the webui. Bizarre, but it seems to be what's necessary.

0.4.1
-----
* Small documentation tweaks
* Fix bug with parsing config file options and rearrange setting some of those
  config struct items, fix typo in sample config file.
* Add disable-webui option for command line and config file to disable the
  chef webui rails app from connecting to goiardi.

0.4.0
-----
* Fix bug with pessimistic matching (https://github.com/ctdk/goiardi/issues/1)
* Add authentication, authorization as an option.
* Add SSL as an option.
* Fixed a few small bugs that turned up while working on authentication.
* Improved test coverage further, both with go tests and a forked chef-pedant
  (https://github.com/ctdk/chef-pedant)
* Updated and expanded documentation.

0.3.3
-----
* Data store and indexer tweaks.
* Improved test coverage.

0.3.0
-----
* Added ability to freeze data store and search index to disk.

0.2.1
-----
* Added support for configuration files.
* Fixed issue parsing flags with newer version of go-flags.

0.2.0
-----
* Initial widely announced release. First version with working search.
