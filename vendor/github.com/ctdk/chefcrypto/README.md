==========

Various cryptographic routines for communicating with chef servers for golang
programs and libraries. Originally part of goiardi, it's been split out for packaging purposes.

Version
-------

Along with some changes for goiardi 1.0.0, this module got set up with a `go.mod` file for excellence in go module support. Per the suggestions from the go people on the go modules documentation pages, the chefcrypto module's version has been bumped to `v1.0.0` -- not because any incompatible changes were made to support goiardi 1.0.0, but because it's set up for go modules now.
