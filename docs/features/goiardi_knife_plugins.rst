Goiardi ``knife`` Plugins
=========================

There is a small collection of knife plugins for goiardi. None of them are strictly required for the general use case, but ``knife-goiardi-index`` is *strongly* suggested for administrators, and the other three are needed for some specific functionality.

The Plugins
-----------

* ``knife-goiardi-index`` - rebuild search indexes. This restores the ``knife index rebuild`` functionality from older versions of knife.
* ``knife-goiardi-event-log``
* ``knife-goiardi-reporting``
* ``knife-shove``
