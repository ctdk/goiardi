* More documentation where appropriate
* Document undocumented functions, methods, and vars (but see moving many
  modules under internal/).
* metrics for universe?
* allow open universes on a per-org basis
* crafty data bag + secrets bit
* AWS Secrets Manager as another option for an external secrets store.
* Various new golang features have become available that goiardi isn't taking
  advantage of. It should do so.
* SQL method cleanup: Since MySQL support was dropped with 1.0.0, there's no
  particularly good reason that there should be postgres_func.go (or the
  equivalent) files separate from sql_funcs.go. The files with all the SQL
  methods should be merged together, and the now superfluous wrapper methods
  should have their contents replaced with the relevant postgres method.

* For 1.0.0 specifics, see TODO-1.0.0
