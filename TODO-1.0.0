* Check out s3 uploads that they'll actually work properly with orgs
* Check out import/export for org appropriateness - may have been done already,
  but may also need updating for things like secrets and s3 for orgs
* Policyfile
* Update oc-chef-pedant to the latest code shipping with chef-server (pedant
  seems to have moved into there, IIRC)

And there's more...

* update the goiardi knife plugins
	o list those knife plugins in the documentation
* update schob for org-ness if needed (it's probably needed)
* goiardi plugin for rebuilding the search index -- this has been removed from
  knife in recent versions
* find link to the last free fake-s3. Also see if the patch in the docs is still
  necessary
* document moving items stored externally, like objects in s3, secrets, etc.
* Move internal modules under github.com/ctdk/goiardi/internal where appropriate
