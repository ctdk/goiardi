* Check out import/export for org appropriateness - may have been done already,
  but may also need updating for things like secrets and s3 for orgs
* Policyfile
* Update oc-chef-pedant to the latest code shipping with chef-server (pedant
  seems to have moved into there, IIRC)

And there's more...

* update the goiardi knife plugins
	o list those knife plugins in the documentation
* document moving items stored externally, like objects in s3, secrets, etc.
* Oh, update the CHANGELOG (dur)
* Once the dust settles, don't forget to update the contents of `sql-files`. As
  part of this, double check that it's all exported correctly.
