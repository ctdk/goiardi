* Orgify metrics
* orgify universe - already done? universe may need some massaging still though.
* Check out s3 uploads that they'll actually work properly with orgs
* Go over new functionality for org appropriateness in general. New items are:
	o metrics
* metrics for universe?
* Check out import/export for org appropriateness - may have been done already,
  but may also need updating for things like secrets and s3 for orgs
* Policyfile
* Update oc-chef-pedant to the latest code shipping with chef-server (pedant
  seems to have moved into there, IIRC)

And there's more...

* update the goiardi knife plugins
	o list those knife plugins in the documentation
* update schob for org-ness if needed (it's probably needed)
* find link to the last free fake-s3. Also see if the patch in the docs is still
  necessary
* document moving items stored externally, like objects in s3, secrets, etc.
* Move internal modules under github.com/ctdk/goiardi/internal where appropriate
