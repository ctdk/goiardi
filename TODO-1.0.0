* Check out s3 uploads that they'll actually work properly with orgs
* Check out import/export for org appropriateness - may have been done already,
  but may also need updating for things like secrets and s3 for orgs
* Policyfile
* Update oc-chef-pedant to the latest code shipping with chef-server (pedant
  seems to have moved into there, IIRC)

And there's more...

* update the goiardi knife plugins
	o list those knife plugins in the documentation
* update schob for org-ness if needed (it's probably needed)
* It seems likely that shovey ought to have a way to sign requests in a way tied  to the organization. Investigate ways to make that happen. Actually, come to
  think of it, there should not be one public key used by all shovey clients
  either.
* find link to the last free fake-s3. Also see if the patch in the docs is still
  necessary
* document moving items stored externally, like objects in s3, secrets, etc.
* Move internal modules under github.com/ctdk/goiardi/internal where appropriate
* Unless something's depending directly on it, remove the chefcrypto/ dir inside
  of goiardi.
* Update stuff in vendor
* Oh, update the CHANGELOG (dur)
* The s3 upload docs have been partially updated, but do need to be finished
  soon.
* As part of org-ifying schob, the shovey docs also need to be updated.
