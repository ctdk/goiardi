Sqitch bundles for deploying SQL databases for goiardi are in here (currently,
the postgres-bundle). See http://sqitch.org/ for more information on sqitch, and
goiardi's README for information on how to deploy the sqitch bundle.

Additionally, for those folks who don't feel like mucking about with sqitch,
dump of the Postgres schema is available. Create the desired database with
whatever owner you want, and load the schema with psql -U <owner> <database> 
< sql-files/goiardi-schema-postgres.sql.

NOTE: If this is not a tagged goiardi release, but rather is a development 
branch, the sqitch bundle and SQL files may not be up to date for this branch.
If so, see https://github.com/ctdk/goiardi-schema for the sqitch files
for the development branch.

NOTE #2: Formerly, this directory contained a sqitch bundle and a database dump
for MySQL in addition to Postgres, but MySQL support was dropped with version 1.0.0.
