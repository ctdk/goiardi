/*
 * We desperately want to avoid circular reference loops with group membership,
 * where one group has another group as a member, and that group in turn has
 * the first group as a member. This also applies if there's more levels than
 * just the one (e.g a -> b -> c -> a). 
 *
 * Thus, we need some way to check for those circular references. The same
 * depgraph stuff cookbooks use for dependency checking (although with the exact
 * same methods) might be the way to go, but since checking the group membership
 * is much simpler than it is with the cookbook dependencies and version
 * constraints (and because I'm not sure that cookbooks can't have circular
 * dependencies, now that I think about it, even though it's Not a Good
 * Patternâ„¢), the first thing to try is a simple map to store whether we've seen
 * a group already.
